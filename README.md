NewsNow wants to set up a website to gain wider audiences.

We need an MVP of a simple system that will serve news to users.

We foresee that there will be huge traffic spikes since we will be relying heavily on influencers to create content and advertise it.

If you want documentation about the system, check [this based on C4 model](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

Also, in order to serve Images to clients on different devices, we decided to create a simple service that dynamically rescales images to different resolutions.

We are going to implement a functional PoC for team allowing them to test it as soon as possible.

You can check it at [apps/image-rescale](apps/image-rescale) folder.
